# SnapShot
SnapShot is a iOS application build using Xcode and [SashiDo](https://www.sashido.io/en/). It is similar to a digital scrapbook as you can take pictures, 
input information and descriptions about where you are, what you are doing, etc., and save those 'memories' to your location on a map.
In addition to searching for memories on the map, you can also find them through different filtering systems (year, month, category).
